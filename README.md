# The exception (This is a non-plugin item)
- When you go to the [folder manager](https://github.com/VennDev/VSharedData/tree/main/manager) I have provided in this plugin directory. It will help you manage which server is running and running it.
- You can setup it in 2 .bat files that I left inside.
- Just support: windows & windows server
